# Quake Asset Starter Pack for Game Devs
This will soon become a repository for a starter kit available to gamedevs who want to use the quake engine, without having to publish the source code for everyone to see.

Right now, it's really just the barest of bones of QuakeC code, but we soon hope to implement a full, total conversion pak0.pak under the bsd license, that includes a test player model, enemies, platforms, and other stuff. Right now, we are currently working on the art assets, so that a QuakeC coder can come along and finish everything.

## ToDo:

### Mandatory:
- Make Player and Enemy Model
- Make Example Levels (partially done)
- Document assets thoroughly (for easy coding)
- Make one first person project, and one 3rd person project
- Make Platforms
- Code QuakeC stuff (SOON!)
- Make Codebase compatible with Vanilla Quake

### Optional:

- Make GUI Asset QC Creator to Streamline Asset coding processes (MMF2?)
- Make Dreamcast compatible version
