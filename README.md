# Quake Asset Starter Pack for Game Devs
This is a repository for a starter kit available to gamedevs who want to use the quake engine, without having to publish the source code for everyone to see.

Right now, it's really just the barest of bones of QuakeC code, but we soon hope to implement a full, total conversion pak0.pak under the bsd license, that includes a test player model, enemies, platforms, and other stuff. Right now, we are currently working on the art assets and improving and adding to the QuakeC code, which has some features already implemented

## ToDo:

### Mandatory:

- Document assets thoroughly (for easy coding)
- Make one first person project, and one 3rd person project

### Optional:

- Make GUI Asset QC Creator to Streamline Asset coding processes (MMF2?)
- Make Dreamcast compatible version

## In Progress:
- Code QuakeC stuff (Partially Done)
- Make Player and Enemy Model (Player Model Acquired but not implemented)
- Make Example Levels (partially done)

## Done
- Make Codebase compatible with Vanilla Quake
