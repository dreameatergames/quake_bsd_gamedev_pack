Model Folder Descriptions:

- Null: These are assets required by the Quake engine to even run the engine. All assets in this 
folder are just simple cube models. If you want to replace them, you can, but if you're going for
a total conversion, you might just not want to mess with these. They will not be supported in
the QuakeC code.
